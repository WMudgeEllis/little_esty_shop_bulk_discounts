# As a merchant
# When I visit my bulk discount show page
# Then I see a link to edit the bulk discount
# When I click this link
# Then I am taken to a new page with a form to edit the discount
# And I see that the discounts current attributes are pre-poluated in the form
# When I change any/all of the information and click submit
# Then I am redirected to the bulk discount's show page
# And I see that the discount's attributes have been updated
